## SEO Best Practices

### Single H1 Tag Rule (CRITICAL)

**Rule**: Each page MUST have exactly ONE H1 tag for optimal SEO.

**Implementation**:
1. **Template H1**: Each slug page template (blog, projects, talks, questions, notes) has ONE H1 tag displaying the title from frontmatter
2. **Markdown Content**: All markdown content files MUST NOT start with H1 (#) headings
3. **Content Structure**: Start markdown content directly with content or H2 (##) headings

**Example - Correct**:
```markdown
---
title: 'My Blog Post Title'  # This becomes the H1 automatically
description: 'Post description'
---

Content starts here immediately, or with an H2 heading:

## Introduction  ✅ Correct - Start with H2
Content here...

### Subsection  ✅ Correct - Use H3 for subsections
More content...
```

**Example - Wrong**:
```markdown
---
title: 'My Blog Post Title'
---

# My Blog Post Title  ❌ Wrong - Don't duplicate title as H1
Content here...

## Introduction
```

**Why This Matters**:
- Multiple H1 tags confuse search engines about page hierarchy
- Google recommends ONE H1 per page representing the main topic
- The page title from frontmatter is automatically rendered as H1 by the template
- All content headings should be H2, H3, H4, etc.

**Verification**:
Run this command to verify no H1 tags exist in markdown content:
```bash
find src/content -name "*.md" -type f -exec grep -l "^# " {} \; | wc -l
```
**Expected result**: `0`

### Trailing Slashes

- Set `trailingSlash: 'always'` in `astro.config.mjs`
- Canonical URLs include trailing slashes
- Prevents duplicate content issues for SEO

## Content Creation

When creating new content files:
1. ❌ **Don't** start markdown files with `# Heading`
2. ❌ **Don't** duplicate the title from frontmatter in the content
3. ✅ **Do** start directly with content or with `## Heading`
4. ✅ **Do** use proper heading hierarchy (H2 → H3 → H4)
5. ✅ **Do** let the page title in frontmatter become the H1 automatically

## Code Comments

In code blocks, always use single `#` for comments (NOT `##`):

**Correct**:
```python
# This is a comment
def my_function():
    # Another comment
    pass
```

**Wrong**:
```python
## This is wrong
def my_function():
    ## Don't do this
    pass
```
