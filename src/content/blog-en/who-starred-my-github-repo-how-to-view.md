By Navigating Directly to the Stargazers Page


The most straightforward method is to manually add /stargazers to the end of your repository's URL.

For example, if your repository's URL is:
`https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name`

You would navigate to:
`https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name/stargazers`

This will take you to a page listing all the users who have starred your repository.
