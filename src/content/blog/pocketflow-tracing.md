*Transform your PocketFlow workflows from black boxes into fully observable, debuggable systems with just one line of code.*

---

## The Challenge: Observability in AI Workflows

Building AI workflows is exciting, but debugging them? Not so much. When your PocketFlow workflow fails or behaves unexpectedly, you're often left asking:

- Which node failed and why?
- What data was flowing between nodes?
- How long did each step take?
- Where exactly did the error occur?
- How can I optimize performance bottlenecks?

Traditional logging approaches require you to manually instrument every node, cluttering your code with observability concerns. You end up spending more time on debugging infrastructure than building your actual AI logic.

**What if there was a better way?**

## Introducing PocketFlow Tracing

We're excited to announce **pocketflow-tracing**, a new package that brings enterprise-grade observability to your PocketFlow workflows with minimal code changes. Built on top of [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com/), it provides comprehensive tracing, monitoring, and debugging capabilities that transform how you develop and maintain AI workflows.

### Key Benefits

🎯 **Zero-Friction Integration**: Add comprehensive tracing with just a single `@trace_flow()` decorator  
📊 **Complete Visibility**: Automatically trace every node execution, input, output, and error  
⚡ **Performance Insights**: Track execution times and identify bottlenecks  
🔍 **Rich Debugging**: View detailed traces in Langfuse's powerful dashboard  
🚀 **Production Ready**: Built for both development and production environments  
🔄 **Async Support**: Full compatibility with AsyncFlow and AsyncNode  

## Before and After: See the Difference

### Before: Manual Logging Nightmare

```python
import logging
import time
from pocketflow import Node, Flow

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

class DataProcessingNode(Node):
    def prep(self, shared):
        start_time = time.time()
        logger.info(f"Starting prep phase with input: {shared}")
        try:
            data = shared.get("input_data")
            result = self._validate_data(data)
            logger.info(f"Prep completed in {time.time() - start_time:.2f}s")
            return result
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Prep failed: {e}")
            raise
    
    def exec(self, data):
        start_time = time.time()
        logger.info(f"Starting exec phase with data: {data}")
        try:
            processed = self._process_data(data)
            logger.info(f"Exec completed in {time.time() - start_time:.2f}s")
            return processed
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Exec failed: {e}")
            raise
    
    def post(self, shared, prep_res, exec_res):
        start_time = time.time()
        logger.info(f"Starting post phase")
        try:
            shared["output"] = exec_res
            logger.info(f"Post completed in {time.time() - start_time:.2f}s")
            return "default"
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Post failed: {e}")
            raise

class DataProcessingFlow(Flow):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(start=DataProcessingNode())
```

### After: Clean Code with Automatic Tracing

```python
from pocketflow import Node, Flow
from pocketflow_tracing import trace_flow

class DataProcessingNode(Node):
    def prep(self, shared):
        data = shared.get("input_data")
        return self._validate_data(data)
    
    def exec(self, data):
        return self._process_data(data)
    
    def post(self, shared, prep_res, exec_res):
        shared["output"] = exec_res
        return "default"

@trace_flow()  # 🎉 That's it! Full observability with one line
class DataProcessingFlow(Flow):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(start=DataProcessingNode())
```

**The difference is striking**: Your code stays clean and focused on business logic, while comprehensive tracing happens automatically behind the scenes.

## Installation and Setup

```env
# Langfuse Configuration
LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY=sk-lf-your-secret-key-here
LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY=pk-lf-your-public-key-here
LANGFUSE_HOST=https://cloud.langfuse.com

# Optional: Enable debug mode for development
POCKETFLOW_TRACING_DEBUG=true
```

**Getting Langfuse Credentials:**
1. Sign up for a free account at [langfuse.com](https://langfuse.com)
2. Create a new project
3. Copy your API keys from the project settings
4. Use `https://cloud.langfuse.com` for the hosted version, or your self-hosted URL

### 3. Add Tracing to Your Flow

```python
from pocketflow import Node, Flow
from pocketflow_tracing import trace_flow

# Your existing node code stays exactly the same
class MyNode(Node):
    def prep(self, shared):
        return shared["input"]
    
    def exec(self, data):
        return f"Processed: {data}"
    
    def post(self, shared, prep_res, exec_res):
        shared["output"] = exec_res
        return "default"

# Just add the decorator - no other changes needed!
@trace_flow()
class MyFlow(Flow):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(start=MyNode())

# Run your flow normally
flow = MyFlow()
shared = {"input": "Hello World"}
flow.run(shared)
```

That's it! Your workflow is now fully traced and observable.

## What Gets Captured

When you run this example, PocketFlow tracing automatically captures:

### Flow-Level Data
- **Execution Metadata**: Start time, end time, total duration
- **Input State**: Complete shared data when flow begins
- **Output State**: Final shared data when flow completes  
- **Flow Result**: The final return value from the flow
- **Error Handling**: Any exceptions with full stack traces

### Node-Level Data
For each node (TicketClassificationNode, TicketRoutingNode), the system traces:

**prep() Phase:**
- Input: Complete shared state
- Output: Prepared data returned by prep method
- Duration: Exact execution time
- Errors: Any exceptions during preparation

**exec() Phase:**
- Input: Data from prep phase
- Output: Processing results
- Duration: Core execution time
- Retry Information: If retries are configured
- Errors: Processing failures with context

**post() Phase:**
- Input: Shared state, prep result, exec result
- Output: Action string for flow control
- Duration: Post-processing time
- State Changes: How shared data was modified
- Errors: Any post-processing issues

## Viewing Your Traces in Langfuse

After running your traced workflows, open your Langfuse dashboard to explore the rich observability data:

### Dashboard Overview
Navigate to your Langfuse host URL (e.g., `https://cloud.langfuse.com`) and you'll see:

- **Traces List**: All your flow executions with timestamps and status
- **Performance Metrics**: Average execution times and success rates
- **Error Tracking**: Failed executions with detailed error information
- **Search and Filtering**: Find specific traces by name, time, or status

### Detailed Trace View
Click on any trace to see:

- **Hierarchical Span View**: Flow → Nodes → Phases in a tree structure
- **Timeline Visualization**: See exactly when each phase executed
- **Input/Output Data**: Complete data flow through your workflow
- **Performance Breakdown**: Time spent in each phase
- **Error Details**: Stack traces and error context when failures occur

The tracing provides unprecedented visibility into your workflow execution, making debugging and optimization straightforward.

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Flow Names and Metadata

```python
@trace_flow(
    flow_name="ProductionDataPipeline",
    session_id="batch-2024-001", 
    user_id="data-team"
)
class DataPipeline(Flow):
    pass
```

### Environment-Based Configuration

```python
from pocketflow_tracing import TracingConfig

# Load custom configuration
config = TracingConfig.from_env()
config.debug = True
config.trace_inputs = True
config.trace_outputs = True

@trace_flow(config=config)
class MyFlow(Flow):
    pass
```

### Selective Tracing Control

```env
# Fine-tune what gets traced
POCKETFLOW_TRACE_INPUTS=true
POCKETFLOW_TRACE_OUTPUTS=true
POCKETFLOW_TRACE_PREP=true
POCKETFLOW_TRACE_EXEC=true
POCKETFLOW_TRACE_POST=true
POCKETFLOW_TRACE_ERRORS=true
```

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

**1. "No traces appearing in dashboard"**
```bash
# Enable debug mode to see what's happening
export POCKETFLOW_TRACING_DEBUG=true
python your_flow.py
```

**2. "Langfuse connection failed"**
- Verify your `.env` file has correct credentials
- Check network connectivity to Langfuse host
- Ensure Langfuse server is running (for self-hosted)

**3. "Import errors"**
```bash
# Ensure package is properly installed
pip install pocketflow-tracing

# For development installation
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

**4. "Performance impact concerns"**
- Tracing adds minimal overhead (typically <5ms per node)
- Disable in production by setting `POCKETFLOW_TRACING_DEBUG=false`
- Use selective tracing to reduce data volume

### Debug Mode Output

When debug mode is enabled, you'll see detailed output like:
```
[TRACING] Initializing Langfuse client...
[TRACING] Starting trace: CustomerSupportTicketAnalysis
[TRACING] Starting node span: TicketClassificationNode.prep
[TRACING] Node span completed in 0.12ms
[TRACING] Trace flushed to Langfuse
```

## Production Considerations

### Performance Impact
- **Minimal Overhead**: Tracing adds typically 1-5ms per node execution
- **Async Processing**: Traces are sent asynchronously to avoid blocking
- **Configurable Depth**: Control what data gets traced to manage volume

### Security and Privacy
- **Data Sanitization**: Implement custom serializers for sensitive data
- **Environment Separation**: Use different Langfuse projects for dev/staging/prod
- **Access Control**: Leverage Langfuse's built-in user management

### Scaling Considerations
- **Batch Processing**: Traces are batched for efficient transmission
- **Error Resilience**: Tracing failures don't affect workflow execution
- **Resource Management**: Automatic cleanup of trace data

## Why This Matters

PocketFlow tracing represents a fundamental shift in how we approach AI workflow development:

**Before**: Developers spent 30-40% of their time debugging workflows with limited visibility into execution flow and data transformations.

**After**: Complete observability out-of-the-box enables developers to focus on building better AI logic instead of debugging infrastructure.

**Real Impact**:
- 🚀 **Faster Development**: Identify issues immediately instead of guessing
- 🔧 **Easier Debugging**: See exactly what happened and when
- 📈 **Performance Optimization**: Identify bottlenecks with precise timing data
- 🛡️ **Production Confidence**: Monitor workflows in real-time
- 👥 **Team Collaboration**: Share traces for collaborative debugging
