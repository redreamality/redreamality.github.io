This is a thoughtful question I've been pondering about the role of AI in software development.

## Key aspects to consider:

1. **AI-assisted coding**: How will AI tools like GitHub Copilot evolve?
2. **Automated testing**: Can AI completely replace human testers?
3. **Architecture design**: Will AI be able to design complex system architectures?
4. **Ethical considerations**: What are the ethical implications of AI-generated code?

## My current thoughts:

While AI will certainly automate many aspects of software development, I believe the most valuable skill will remain the ability to ask the right questions and understand complex system requirements.

## Open questions:

- How will the role of software engineers change?
- What new skills will be required?
- How do we ensure quality and security in AI-generated code?

This is an evolving question that I continue to explore as AI technology advances.
