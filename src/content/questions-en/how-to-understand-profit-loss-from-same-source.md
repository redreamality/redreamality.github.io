# How to Understand "Profit and Loss from the Same Source"?

In trading, you might frequently hear the phrase "profit and loss from the same source." This sounds contradictory - profit and loss are clearly opposite results, how can they come from the same source? But this phrase contains profound trading philosophy. Understanding "profit and loss from the same source" is an essential path for every trader toward maturity.

## Short Answer

**"Profit and loss from the same source" means: profits and losses both come from the same trading system, the same trading philosophy, the same set of execution rules.** You can't accept the profits that your system brings while refusing the losses that your system brings. If your system can generate large profits, it will inevitably generate corresponding losses. Trying to "optimize" to eliminate all losses often also eliminates the opportunities that bring profits. Understanding profit and loss from the same source means accepting trading uncertainty, accepting that losses are part of trading.

This answer gives basic explanation of profit and loss from same source, but this concept has deeper meaning.

## Core Meaning of Profit and Loss from Same Source

"Profit and loss from the same source" isn't a simple maxim but a complete trading philosophy.

### Meaning 1: Unity of System and Results

**Trading System Determines Trading Results**

What results will a trading system produce?
- Generates a series of trading signals
- Each signal has possibility of profit and possibility of loss
- System's profits come from the overall of multiple trades
- System's losses also come from the overall of multiple trades

**Core Cognition:**
You can't only select the profitable trades from your system while refusing the losing trades. The value of a system lies in the sum of all trades it generates, not just a few successful trades.

**Example:**
Suppose your trading system has 40% win rate, but average profit is twice average loss. For every 10 trades:
- 6 losing trades: Each loses 100 yuan, total loss 600 yuan
- 4 winning trades: Each profits 200 yuan, total profit 800 yuan
- Total result: 10 trades net profit 200 yuan

If because you dislike losses, you refuse to execute the 6 losing trades:
- You only execute the 4 winning trades
- But you can't know which 6 trades are losses (because before each trade you don't know result)
- If selective execution, system loses its statistical advantage
- Final result will actually be worse

### Meaning 2: Unity of Philosophy and Execution

**Trading Philosophy Produces Results Through Execution**

Your trading philosophy determines your trading behavior:
- Your trading philosophy believes "trend-following is optimal"
- So you will enter following trend in trends
- Trend-following will bring profits, will also bring losses (because not all trends can continue)

**Core Cognition:**
You can't only execute the "should be profitable" part of your trading philosophy while refusing the "might lose" part. Once you start selective execution, your trading philosophy has already changed.

**Example:**
Your philosophy is "buy at support, sell at resistance"
- Buying at support: Might bounce profit, might break loss
- Selling at resistance: Might meet resistance profit, might breakout loss

If you see support level, but worry it might break and don't buy:
- You've violated your trading philosophy
- Your philosophy has changed from "buy at support" to "buy only after confirming support is effective"
- This is a different philosophy, results will also be different

### Meaning 3: Symmetry of Risk and Return

**Taking Risk is Prerequisite for Gaining Return**

Another important meaning of profit and loss from same source is: To gain returns, you must take risks. Risk and return are symmetrical, you can't take only one.

**Core Cognition:**
- Without taking risk, you can't gain returns
- The type of risk you take determines the type of returns you can gain
- Trying to eliminate all risks equals eliminating all return opportunities

**Example:**
- Long trading: Take risk of price falling, gain returns of price rising
- Short trading: Take risk of price rising, gain returns of price falling
- Volatility trading: Take risk of wrong direction, gain returns of volatility rising

If you refuse to take a certain type of risk, you also give up the corresponding return opportunity. For example:
- You refuse to take pullback risk (don't enter if no pullback)
- You also give up the large profit opportunity of entering following trend at pullback end

### Meaning 4: Unity of Process

**Same Process, Different Results**

The deeper meaning of profit and loss from same source is: Profits and losses come from the same trading process.

**Core Cognition:**
- Any single trade's result is random
- But trading process is unified, systematic
- Profits and losses are different manifestations of this unified process
- Key is correctness of process, not single result

**Example:**
Suppose you have a complete trading system, and strictly execute according to system every time:
- Trade 1: Strictly follow system execution, profit +1000
- Trade 2: Strictly follow system execution, loss -500
- Trade 3: Strictly follow system execution, profit +800
- Trade 4: Strictly follow system execution, loss -400
- ...

Every execution process is the same (strictly follow system), but results are different (some profit, some loss). If because of one loss you question the system, or next time don't strictly execute, you destroy the process unity.

## Practical Meaning of Profit and Loss from Same Source

Understanding profit and loss from same source, what guidance does it provide for actual trading?

### Meaning 1: Accept Trading Uncertainty

**Accept Randomness of Single Results**

Profit and loss from same source tells us: Any single trade's result is uncertain. Even with excellent trading system, can't guarantee single trade must be profitable.

**Correct Attitude:**
1. Admit uncertainty of single trade results
2. Don't predict single trade results
3. Focus on overall results of multiple trades
4. Accept losses are part of trading

**Wrong Cognition:**
- Hope to profit before every trade
- Think system has problems when loss occurs
- Think you're a genius when profit occurs
- Emotion fluctuates with single results

### Meaning 2: Persist in Executing Trading System

**Complete Execution, Not Selective Execution**

Profit and loss from same source requires us: Completely execute trading system, not selectively execute.

**How to Persist in Execution:**
1. Before each trade, don't prejudge result
2. Every trade strictly execute according to system rules
3. Don't stop execution because of recent losses
4. Don't increase position because of recent profits
5. Only evaluate overall results of multiple trades

**Consequences of Selective Execution:**
- Destroys system's statistical advantage
- Loses foundation of profit and loss from same source
- Final results often worse
- Falls into emotional trading vicious cycle

### Meaning 3: Evaluate System with Long-term Perspective

**Don't Judge System by Short-term Results**

Profit and loss from same source requires us: Evaluate trading system with long-term results, not short-term results.

**Correct Evaluation Method:**
1. Set sufficient sample size (for example, at least 100 trades)
2. Evaluate overall results of these trades
3. Focus on overall win rate, profit-loss ratio, maximum drawdown and other indicators
4. If overall results meet expectations, system is effective
5. Continue executing system, not affected by short-term results

**Wrong Evaluation Method:**
- Seeing 3 consecutive losses, think system failed
- Seeing 5 consecutive profits, think you're trading genius
- Adjust system based on recent results
- Frequently change system, can't evaluate its effectiveness

### Meaning 4: Risk Control Is Prerequisite

**Control Risk on Basis of Profit and Loss from Same Source**

Understanding profit and loss from same source doesn't mean passively accepting all losses. Profit and loss from same source is the foundation, on this foundation, still need risk control.

**Risk Control Principles:**
1. Control risk of each trade (for example, not exceeding 2% of total capital)
2. Control risk of consecutive losses (set maximum consecutive loss count, pause trading when reached)
3. Control risk of total drawdown (set maximum drawdown ratio, adjust position when reached)
4. Ensure in worst case, capital won't be zero

**Profit and Loss from Same Source + Risk Control:**
- Profit and loss from same source: Accept profits and losses brought by system
- Risk control: Ensure even in worst case, capital is safe
- Combination: On basis of long-term system execution, control risk

## Misconceptions of Profit and Loss from Same Source

When understanding profit and loss from same source, avoid these misconceptions.

### Misconception 1: Profit and Loss from Same Source Means Must Accept All Losses

**Misconception: Profit and loss from same source means passively accept all losses, don't make any adjustments**

Reality:
- Foundation of profit and loss from same source is system is effective
- If system really has problems, should adjust or change
- But adjust based on long-term statistics, not short-term results
- Not eliminate all losses, but ensure profit-loss ratio is reasonable

### Misconception 2: Larger Losses Mean Larger Future Profits

**Misconception: Think losses and profits are equivalent, larger losses mean larger profit opportunities**

Reality:
- Profit and loss from same source doesn't mean quantity of losses equals quantity of profits
- But says losses and profits both come from same system
- If system's profit-loss ratio is 2:1, then average profit is 2 times average loss
- Not the more losses the better, but system's overall profit-loss ratio should be reasonable

### Misconception 3: No Need for Stop Loss

**Misconception: Profit and loss from same source means let losses naturally develop, no need for stop loss**

Reality:
- Profit and loss from same source is under premise of having risk control
- Stop loss is important component of risk control
- Stop loss doesn't change trading system, but controls maximum risk of each trade
- Profit and loss from same source + stop loss = Accept losses of system stops, control uncontrollable risks

### Misconception 4: Profit and Loss from Same Source Only Applies to Trend Following

**Misconception: Think profit and loss from same source only applies to trend-following strategies**

Reality:
- Profit and loss from same source applies to all types of trading systems
- Whether trend-following, mean-reversion, or other strategies
- As long as system trading, should accept all results brought by system
- Key is system effectiveness, not strategy type

## Quantitative Perspective of Profit and Loss from Same Source

From quantitative trading perspective, how to understand profit and loss from same source?

### Statistics Perspective

**Statistical Distribution of Trading Results**

Quantitative trading treats trading results as a statistical distribution:
- Each trade's result is random variable
- This random variable has determined distribution (normal distribution, or other distributions)
- This distribution is determined by trading system
- Profits and losses are manifestations of this distribution

**Quantitative Meaning of Profit and Loss from Same Source:**
- You can't only take profit part of distribution, reject loss part
- System's expected value = Sum of all trade results / Number of trades
- If expected value > 0, system in long-term is positive expectation
- Key is expected value, not single result

### Backtesting Perspective

**Backtesting Reflects System's Overall Performance**

Quantitative trading evaluates trading systems through backtesting:
- Backtesting simulates system's performance on historical data
- Backtesting results include all system's profits and losses
- Backtesting's expected value reflects system's long-term performance

**Manifestation of Profit and Loss from Same Source in Backtesting:**
- Backtesting shows system's total profits and total losses
- If total profits > total losses, system has positive expectation
- You can't only select profitable trades in backtesting, reject losing trades
- Because before each trade, you don't know result

### Execution Perspective

**Algorithm Execution Unity**

Another characteristic of quantitative trading is: Algorithms automatically execute trades, guaranteeing execution unity.

**Manifestation of Profit and Loss from Same Source in Algorithm Execution:**
- Every trade strictly executes according to algorithm rules
- Not affected by emotions
- Not selective execution
- Guarantees trading process unity

- This is exactly what profit and loss from same source requires: Same process, different results

## Practical Application: How to Apply Profit and Loss from Same Source in Trading?

### Step 1: Build or Select a Trading System

**System Should Satisfy:**
1. Has clear entry and exit rules
2. Has clear risk control rules
3. Through historical data verification has positive expectation
4. Fits your trading style and risk preference

### Step 2: Understand System's Profit-Loss Characteristics

**Understand System's:**
1. Win rate: Ratio of profitable trades to total trades
2. Average profit: Average profit of profitable trades
3. Average loss: Average loss of losing trades
4. Profit-loss ratio: Average profit / Average loss
5. Maximum drawdown: Historical maximum drawdown

These characteristics determine system's overall performance, also are foundation of understanding profit and loss from same source.

### Step 3: Set Risk Control

**Set Based on System Characteristics:**
1. Per-trade risk: For example, not exceeding 2% of total capital
2. Maximum consecutive losses: For example, pause trading after 5 consecutive losses
3. Maximum drawdown: For example, adjust position when total capital drawdown exceeds 20%
4. Position size: Dynamically adjust based on system characteristics

### Step 4: Execute and Record

**Execute and Record Each Trade:**
1. Strictly execute according to system rules
2. Record detailed situation of each trade
3. Record result of each trade
4. Record your psychological state

### Step 5: Regularly Evaluate

**Regularly Evaluate System Performance:**
1. For example, evaluate every 30 trades
2. Evaluate if overall results meet expectations
3. If meet expectations, continue execution
4. If don't meet expectations, analyze reasons:
   - System itself has problems?
   - Execution has problems?
   - Market environment changed?
   - Risk control has problems?

### Step 6: Optimize, Not Change

**Optimize System, Not Arbitrarily Change:**
1. If system overall meets expectations, don't change because of short-term results
2. Optimization should be based on long-term statistics, not short-term results
3. Optimization should have theoretical basis, not based on feelings
4. After each optimization, re-verify through backtesting

## Conclusion

"Profit and loss from the same source" is core trading philosophy, understanding it requires recognizing:

1. **Unity of System and Results**: Trading system determines trading results, can't only select profits
2. **Unity of Philosophy and Execution**: Trading philosophy produces results through execution, can't selectively execute
3. **Symmetry of Risk and Return**: Taking risk is prerequisite for gaining returns
4. **Unity of Process**: Same process produces different results, key is process

In practical meaning:
1. **Accept Uncertainty**: Single result uncertain, focus on long-term results
2. **Persist in System Execution**: Complete execution, not selective execution
3. **Long-term Evaluate System**: Don't judge system by short-term results
4. **Risk Control Is Prerequisite**: Control risk on basis of profit and loss from same source

In quantitative trading, "profit and loss from same source" isn't vague philosophical concept but specific execution principles:

- Algorithms strictly execute every trade according to rules
- System's expected value determined by all trades
- Not selective execution, guarantee statistical advantage
- Use risk control to ensure capital safety

Essence of profit and loss from same source is: Accept trading uncertainty, accept losses are part of trading, persist in executing effective trading systems, let probability advantage work in long-term.

Understanding profit and loss from same source is stepping out from the fantasy of "profit every time" and accepting reality of "long-term profit," this is every trader's necessary path to maturity.
