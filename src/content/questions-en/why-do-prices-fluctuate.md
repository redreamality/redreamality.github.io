# Why Do Prices Fluctuate?

If you're just starting out in financial markets, the first thing that might confuse you is: why do prices keep going up and down? Up 5% today, down 3% tomorrow, it seems completely random. But actually, there's a very clear logic behind price fluctuations. Understanding this logic is crucial for becoming a better investor or trader.

## Short Answer

**Prices fluctuate because market participants have different expectations about the future.** Buyers think prices will go up, sellers think prices will go down, and both sides compete in the market. The final price is a compromise between both sides. When these expectations change, prices fluctuate.

This answer sounds simple, but it contains a complex set of market mechanisms. Let's break it down step by step.

## The Nature of Fluctuation: Information Asymmetry

To understand price fluctuations, we must first understand a core concept: **information asymmetry**.

### What is Information Asymmetry?

Imagine a scenario: you and a friend are buying and selling an antique. You know its authenticity and value, but your friend doesn't. This is information asymmetry.

In financial markets, the same thing happens every day:
- Someone knows a company is about to release positive news
- Someone has deeper understanding of the macro economy
- Someone has technical analysis signals that others don't know
- Someone has unique insights into an industry

### How Does Information Asymmetry Cause Fluctuations?

When information spreads in the market, it doesn't reach everyone instantly. This process is gradual:

**Stage 1: Information Appears**
Only a few people know certain information. For example, an insider at a company knows the company is about to sign a major contract.

**Stage 2: Information Diffuses**
Insiders start trading, and the price starts showing subtle changes. Sensitive traders notice these changes and start following.

**Stage 3: Information Becomes Public**
When information is truly public, most people know, and the price fluctuates significantly.

**Stage 4: Information Digestion**
Market participants digest this information, and the price gradually stabilizes at a new level.

During this process, price fluctuations at each stage are the result of different people getting the same information at different times.

## Dynamic Balance of Supply and Demand

The most direct reason for price fluctuations is changes in the relationship between supply and demand. But supply and demand are not static - they are dynamic and constantly changing.

### Elasticity of Supply and Demand

**The concept of elasticity sounds a bit academic, but it's simple.**

Imagine two types of goods:
1. **Bread**: If bread prices double, you might still buy it because you need to eat. This is called inelastic demand.
2. **Luxury bags**: If luxury bag prices double, many people will choose not to buy. This is called elastic demand.

In financial markets:
- **Necessities** (like healthcare company stocks) have relatively inelastic demand
- **Highly speculative assets** (like cryptocurrencies, small-cap stocks) have very elastic demand

The impact of elasticity on price fluctuations:
- **Assets with elastic demand**: Slight price changes trigger large amounts of buying or selling, causing sharp price fluctuations
- **Assets with inelastic demand**: Even if prices change, trading volume won't change significantly, so price fluctuations are relatively moderate

### Changes on the Supply Side

Changes on the supply side also cause price fluctuations:

**Supply in Stock Markets**
- Companies issuing new shares
- Major shareholders reducing holdings
- Employee stock plan unlocks
- Stock buybacks (reducing supply)

**Supply in Futures Markets**
- Changes in inventory levels
- Adjustments to production capacity
- New production expectations

**Supply in Bond Markets**
- Governments issuing new bonds
- Companies issuing corporate bonds
- Bond maturity (reducing supply)

Every change in supply disrupts the original balance of supply and demand, causing prices to seek a new equilibrium - this process manifests as price fluctuations.

## Diversification of Market Participants

There are many different types of participants in financial markets, and their goals, time horizons, and risk preferences are all different. This diversification itself is a source of price fluctuations.

### Institutional Investors

**Mutual funds, pension funds, insurance companies** - these institutional investors have these characteristics:
- Large amounts of capital
- Long investment horizons
- Clear performance evaluation standards
- Risk control requirements

Their behavioral characteristics:
- **Trend following**: When trends form, institutions follow in large numbers, reinforcing trends
- **Portfolio rebalancing**: Regularly adjusting portfolios, causing related stock price fluctuations
- **Quarter-end effects**: To beautify performance, there are position adjustments at quarter-end

### Hedge Funds

Hedge fund behavior is more complex:
- **Leveraged trading**: Using small capital to leverage large positions, amplifying price fluctuations
- **Quantitative strategies**: Algorithmic trading may trigger large amounts of buying and selling at the millisecond level
- **Arbitrage trading**: Cross-market arbitrage leads related products' prices to change
- **Shorting mechanism**: Shorting intensifies downtrends

### Individual Investors

The characteristics of individual investors (retail):
- **Emotional trading**: Easily driven by greed and fear
- **Herd effect**: Buy when they see others buying, sell when they see others selling
- **Scattered capital**: Small amounts individually, but large in number

### Market Makers and High-Frequency Traders

These participants provide liquidity:
- **Market makers**: Quote both bid and ask prices simultaneously, earning the spread
- **High-frequency traders**: Capture small spreads at the millisecond level

Their behavioral characteristics:
- **Provide liquidity**: Make it easier for others to buy and sell
- **Amplify short-term fluctuations**: Large numbers of small trades may amplify price fluctuations
- **Flash crashes**: Algorithms interacting with each other may cause sharp price declines in very short periods

## The Role of Market Psychology

Price fluctuations are not just rational calculations - they are deeply influenced by market psychology.

### Greed and Fear

These are the two strongest emotional forces in the market:

**Greed** drives prices up:
- Fear of Missing Out (FOMO): Seeing others make money makes you want to enter too
- Overconfidence: Believing you can catch the last segment of the rise
- Chasing highs: The higher the price, the more you want to buy

**Fear** drives prices down:
- Stop-loss selling: When losses reach a certain point, you stop losses
- Panic selling: Seeing others sell makes you follow
- Risk aversion: When market uncertainty increases, choose to leave

### Herd Effect

Humans are social animals, and this instinct extends to financial markets:

**Chasing Highs**
When prices rise, more and more people are attracted:
- News media starts reporting
- Friends discuss it in social circles
- Seeing others make money

This force pushes prices higher until they can't be sustained.

**Selling Lows**
When prices fall, panic spreads:
- Worried about losses expanding
- Hearing negative news
- Seeing others sell

This force pushes prices lower until value investors enter to catch the falling knife.

### Anchoring Effect

People are influenced by previous prices when making decisions:

**High Anchor**
When prices fall from 100 to 80, many people feel "it's cheap":
- Because their psychological anchor is 100
- Even if 80 is still overvalued, they will buy
- This supports the price for a while

**Low Anchor**
When prices rise from 50 to 60, many people feel "it's expensive":
- Because their psychological anchor is 50
- Even if 60 is still undervalued, they will sell
- This suppresses price increases

### Loss Aversion

Psychological research finds that people's pain from losses is twice as intense as their pleasure from equivalent gains:

**Reluctance to Stop Loss**
When prices fall:
- At 10% loss, many choose to hold and wait for a rebound
- At 20% loss, even more reluctant to stop loss because "already lost so much"
- This prevents prices from falling quickly, forming support

**Urgency to Take Profits**
When prices rise:
- At 10% profit, many want to lock in gains
- Worried about profit retracement
- This prevents prices from rising quickly, forming resistance

## The Impact of Macro Factors

Price fluctuations are not just micro-level games - macro factors also play an important role.

### Business Cycle

Asset prices perform differently in different stages of the business cycle:

**Expansion Phase**
- Corporate earnings grow, stock prices rise
- Consumption increases, commodity prices rise
- Inflationary pressure increases, central banks may raise interest rates

**Recession Phase**
- Corporate earnings decline, stock prices fall
- Consumption decreases, commodity prices fall
- Inflationary pressure eases, central banks may cut interest rates

**Business Cycle Transitions**
When the economy transitions from one stage to another, asset prices fluctuate significantly:
- Investors' expectations about economic outlook change
- Capital reallocated between different asset classes
- Market sentiment shifts from optimistic to pessimistic or vice versa

### Monetary Policy

Central banks' monetary policy has a huge impact on price fluctuations:

**Interest Rate Policy**
- Rate hikes: Increase corporate financing costs, suppress stock and bond prices
- Rate cuts: Reduce corporate financing costs, stimulate stock and bond prices
- Rate expectations: Just expectations of rate changes are enough to cause price fluctuations

**Quantitative Easing**
- Central banks buy assets, directly pushing up prices
- Increased market liquidity increases speculative activity
- Asset prices rise, potentially forming bubbles

**Tightening Policy**
- Central banks sell assets, directly pushing down prices
- Reduced market liquidity decreases speculative activity
- Asset prices fall, potentially triggering crashes

### Geopolitics

Geopolitical events cause sharp price fluctuations:

**Wars and Conflicts**
- Energy prices soar
- Safe-haven assets rise (gold, US dollar)
- Asset prices in affected regions plummet

**Trade Wars**
- Tariffs cause related commodity price fluctuations
- Affected companies' stock prices fluctuate
- Significant exchange rate fluctuations

**Political Uncertainty**
- Increased price volatility during elections
- Policy changes cause related industry fluctuations
- Regulatory changes cause market structure changes

## Technical Factors

Price fluctuations also come from the market's own technical factors.

### Margin and Leverage

**Leverage Amplifies Fluctuations**
- 10x leverage means a 1% price fluctuation means a 10% fluctuation in your capital
- When prices move against you, it may trigger forced liquidation
- Forced liquidation intensifies price fluctuations, creating a vicious cycle

**Margin Calls**
- When account balance falls below maintenance margin, need to add funds
- If unable to add funds, forced liquidation occurs
- Concentrated forced liquidation leads to price crashes

### Stop Loss and Take Profit Orders

**Stop Loss Orders**
Large amounts of stop loss orders concentrated at certain price levels:
- When prices hit these levels, large sell orders are triggered
- Causing prices to fall rapidly
- May break through support levels, triggering more stop losses

**Take Profit Orders**
Similarly, take profit orders also affect prices:
- When prices reach certain levels, large amounts of profit-taking occurs
- Causing price pullbacks
- Potentially forming short-term tops

### Option Expiration

**Option Expiration Dates**
- Market makers need to hedge their option positions
- Large amounts of hedging trades executed near expiration
- Causing increased price volatility

**Gamma Risk**
- When prices approach strike prices, market makers need to adjust hedge ratios
- This adjustment pushes prices further toward strike prices
- Creating what's called the "magnet effect"

## The Flow and Propagation of Information

Price fluctuations are also related to how information flows.

### Hierarchy of Information Dissemination

**Inside Information**
- People who know first start trading
- Prices start showing subtle changes
- Technical analysts may capture these changes

**Professional Analysis**
- Analysts and institutions start researching
- Research reports released
- Institutions start adjusting positions

**Public Information**
- News media reports
- Ordinary investors get information
- Large numbers of retail investors enter

**Post-Event Analysis**
- Review events, summarize lessons learned
- Form new market perceptions
- Influence future trading behavior

### Uncertainty of Information

Information itself can also be uncertain:
- **Preliminary information**: May be inaccurate or incomplete
- **Subsequent corrections**: New information may overturn previous judgments
- **Contradictory**: Information from different sources may conflict

This uncertainty leads to:
- Investor hesitation
- Increased market volatility
- Frequent price ups and downs

## Changes in Liquidity

Market liquidity is an important factor affecting price fluctuations.

### Liquidity Drying Up

**Signs of Liquidity Drying Up**
- Bid-ask spreads widen
- Small trades cause large price movements
- Difficulty executing large orders

**Causes of Liquidity Drying Up**
- Major events cause market panic
- Outside trading hours (like weekends, holidays)
- Before holidays

**Consequences of Liquidity Drying Up**
- Increased price volatility
- Easy to experience flash crashes
- Difficult to execute large orders

### Liquidity Abundance

**Signs of Liquidity Abundance**
- Bid-ask spreads narrow
- Large trades have little impact on prices
- Easy to execute

**Causes of Liquidity Abundance**
- Central banks inject large amounts of liquidity
- Optimistic market sentiment
- Large amounts of capital flowing into the market

**Consequences of Liquidity Abundance**
- Broad asset price increases
- Potentially forming bubbles
- Risk underestimated

## Self-Reinforcement of Fluctuations

Price fluctuations sometimes self-reinforce, forming positive feedback loops.

### Trend Reinforcement

**Uptrend**
- Price rises → technical indicators turn bullish → more buyers enter → price continues rising
- Price rises → media coverage → attracts more attention → more capital enters → price continues rising
- Price rises → stop losses get taken out → shorts forced to cover → price continues rising

**Downtrend**
- Price falls → technical indicators turn bearish → more sellers exit → price continues falling
- Price falls → negative coverage → triggers panic → more selling → price continues falling
- Price falls → longs forced to stop loss → longs liquidate → price continues falling

### Volatility Clustering

**Volatility Clustering Phenomenon**
- High volatility periods are often followed by high volatility periods
- Low volatility periods are often followed by low volatility periods
- Volatility is not random but shows clustering characteristics

**Causes of Volatility Clustering**
- The impact of major events doesn't dissipate instantly
- Market participants' risk preferences remain relatively stable for a period
- The effects of leverage and margin last for a period

## Measuring Fluctuations

In quantitative trading, we use mathematical methods to measure volatility.

### Historical Volatility

**Standard Deviation**
Measures the degree to which prices deviate from the average:
- The larger the standard deviation, the greater the volatility
- Typically calculate 20-day, 60-day, 252-day (one year) standard deviation
- Can be used to compare volatility of different assets

**True Range**
Considering gap openings:
- True Range = max(H-L, |H-PC|, |L-PC|)
- H = Today's high
- L = Today's low
- PC = Previous day's close
- Take the average of the last N days

### Implied Volatility

**Volatility Expectations Reflected in Options Market**
- Volatility implied from option prices
- Represents market's expectations for future volatility
- VIX (Fear Index) is the implied volatility of S&P 500

**Significance of Implied Volatility**
- Implied volatility > Historical volatility: Market expects future volatility to increase
- Implied volatility < Historical volatility: Market expects future volatility to decrease
- Implied volatility too high: May mean market is excessively fearful

## The Nature of Volatility

From a quantitative trading perspective, volatility has these essential characteristics:

### Volatility Mean Reversion

**In the long run, volatility reverts to the mean**
- Extremely high volatility won't persist forever
- Extremely low volatility won't persist forever
- This provides opportunities for volatility trading

### Volatility Clustering

**Volatility is not randomly distributed**
- High volatility periods often appear consecutively
- Low volatility periods often appear consecutively
- This is called "volatility clustering" or "ARCH effect"

### Volatility Asymmetry

**Volatility behaves differently during uptrends and downtrends**
- Volatility is usually greater during declines than during rises
- This is called the "leverage effect"
- The reason is that panic levels are higher during declines

## How to Deal with Price Fluctuations

After understanding price fluctuations, the key is how to deal with them.

### Identify Sources of Volatility

**Systemic Volatility**
- Caused by systemic factors like macroeconomy, monetary policy
- Affects the entire market or most assets
- Hard to avoid through diversification

**Idiosyncratic Volatility**
- Caused by specific company or industry events
- Only affects specific assets
- Can be reduced through diversification

### Volatility Trading Strategies

**Trend Following**
- In high volatility periods, trends are often more pronounced
- Suitable for using trend following strategies
- But need to pay attention to risk management

**Mean Reversion**
- When volatility is too high, expect it to revert
- When volatility is too low, expect it to increase
- Can trade volatility itself

**Options Strategies**
- Buy options: Long volatility
- Sell options: Short volatility
- Choose strategies based on volatility expectations

### Risk Management

**Position Sizing**
- Reduce position size during high volatility periods
- Can appropriately increase position size during low volatility periods
- Dynamically adjust positions based on volatility

**Stop Loss Placement**
- The higher the volatility, the wider your stop loss needs to be
- The lower the volatility, the narrower your stop loss can be
- Avoid being stopped out by normal fluctuations

**Diversification**
- Different assets have different correlations
- Diversification can reduce portfolio volatility
- But be aware of systemic risk

## Conclusion

Price fluctuation is an essential characteristic of financial markets, and it comes from:

1. **Information asymmetry**: Different people get the same information at different times
2. **Supply and demand changes**: Dynamic changes in supply and demand cause prices to seek new equilibrium
3. **Participant diversification**: Different types of investors have different goals and behaviors
4. **Market psychology**: Greed, fear, herd effect and other emotions drive price fluctuations
5. **Macro factors**: Economic cycle, monetary policy, geopolitics and other impacts
6. **Technical factors**: Leverage, stop loss, options and other technical factors
7. **Information flow**: The process of information dissemination and digestion
8. **Liquidity changes**: Abundance and drying up of liquidity
9. **Self-reinforcement**: Fluctuations self-reinforce, forming trends

Understanding the reasons for price fluctuations is not to eliminate fluctuations, but to:
- Expect when fluctuations will happen
- Understand why fluctuations happen
- Develop strategies to deal with fluctuations
- Find opportunities in fluctuations

In quantitative trading, we don't try to predict how prices will fluctuate, but:
- Quantify the characteristics of volatility
- Identify patterns of volatility
- Use volatility rules to develop strategies
- Strictly control risk

Price fluctuation is not a defect of the market, but the essence of the market. Without fluctuation, there are no trading opportunities. Understanding and accepting fluctuation, using fluctuation, is the mark of a mature trader.
