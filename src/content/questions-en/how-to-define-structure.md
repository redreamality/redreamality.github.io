# How to Define Structure?

If you've studied technical analysis, you've definitely heard the concept of "market structure." Some say "structure is complete," others say "structure is broken," but what exactly is structure? How does it differ from "swings"? What's the relationship between structure and "trend"?

This question seems fundamental, but understanding structure is key to mastering technical analysis. Structure is the skeleton of price action, the foundation of trend analysis, the framework for developing trading strategies.

## Short Answer

**Market structure is the relative positional relationship between price highs and lows, which defines the market's direction and state.** Simply put, structure is how price arranges from low to high, then from high to low. When price continuously makes higher highs and higher lows, we say structure is up (uptrend structure); when price continuously makes lower lows and lower highs, we say structure is down (downtrend structure); when highs and lows are around the same level, we say structure is sideways (ranging structure).

This answer gives the basic definition of structure, but the concept goes much further. Let's explore in depth from multiple perspectives.

## Structure's Core: Arrangement of Highs and Lows

The core of structure is the relative relationship between highs and lows. Understanding this means understanding the essence of structure.

### What Are Highs and Lows?

**Highs (Peaks):**
- Highest price formed within certain price range
- This price is higher than previous N and next N candles
- After high forms, price usually retreats
- Highs are potential resistance levels

**Lows (Troughs):**
- Lowest price formed within certain price range
- This price is lower than previous N and next N candles
- After low forms, price usually bounces
- Lows are potential support levels

**Confirmation of Highs/Lows:**
Not every candle's high/low is a high/low point. Only when price truly turns can we confirm this is a high or low:
- Price changes from rising to falling, confirming high
- Price changes from falling to rising, confirming low

### Three Basic Forms of Structure

Based on arrangement of highs and lows, structure has three basic forms:

**Uptrend Structure (Upward Trend Structure):**
- Higher Highs (HH)
- Higher Lows (HL)
- Both highs and lows continuously rising
- Indicates buying pressure dominates

**Downtrend Structure (Downward Trend Structure):**
- Lower Highs (LH)
- Lower Lows (LL)
- Both highs and lows continuously falling
- Indicates selling pressure dominates

**Sideways Structure (Horizontal Structure):**
- Highs around same level
- Lows around same level
- No clear upward or downward trend in highs/lows
- Indicates buying and selling pressure balanced

### Structure Confirmation

Structure doesn't happen instantly, needs confirmation:

**Uptrend Structure Confirmation:**
1. Price rises from low A to high B
2. Price pulls back from high B to low C
3. Low C must be higher than low A (HL)
4. Price rises from low C to higher high D
5. High D must be higher than high B (HH)
6. Uptrend structure confirmed complete

**Downtrend Structure Confirmation:**
1. Price falls from high A to low B
2. Price bounces from low B to high C
3. High C must be lower than high A (LH)
4. Price falls from high C to lower low D
5. Low D must be lower than low B (LL)
6. Downtrend structure confirmed complete

**Sideways Structure Confirmation:**
1. Price fluctuates within certain range multiple times
2. Highs basically at same level
3. Lows basically at same level
4. Range boundaries touched multiple times but not broken
5. Sideways structure confirmed stable

## Relationship Between Structure and Swings

Structure and swings are often confused, but they're different concepts.

### Swings vs Structure

**Swings focus on:**
- Magnitude and duration of single price movement
- From one turning point to next turning point
- Single rise/fall process

**Structure focuses on:**
- Relationship between multiple swings
- Arrangement of highs and lows
- Overall state and direction of market

**Example:**

**Swing Perspective:**
- From low 100 to high 150, this is up swing
- From high 150 to low 130, this is down swing
- From low 130 to high 160, this is next up swing

**Structure Perspective:**
- Low 100, high 150, low 130, high 160
- Low 130 > low 100 (HL)
- High 160 > high 150 (HH)
- Forms uptrend structure

### Structure Completeness

Structure needs complete swings to confirm:

**Uptrend Structure Completeness:**
Needs at least two swings:
- Swing 1: Low A → High B (up swing)
- Swing 2: High B → Low C (down swing)
- Requirement: Low C > Low A
- Then needs third swing to confirm:
- Swing 3: Low C → High D (up swing)
- Requirement: High D > High B

**Downtrend Structure Completeness:**
Needs at least two swings:
- Swing 1: High A → Low B (down swing)
- Swing 2: Low B → High C (up swing)
- Requirement: High C < High A
- Then needs third swing to confirm:
- Swing 3: High C → Low D (down swing)
- Requirement: Low D < Low B

### Structure Levels

Structure is layered, with different levels having different highs and lows:

**Major Structure:**
- Composed of major swings
- Major highs/lows of major swings
- Defines long-term trend

**Medium Structure:**
- Composed of medium swings
- Medium highs/lows of medium swings
- Defines intermediate trend

**Minor Structure:**
- Composed of minor swings
- Minor highs/lows of minor swings
- Defines short-term trend

**Structure Nesting:**
- Major structure contains medium structure
- Medium structure contains minor structure
- Minor structure changes may预示 major structure turn

## Structure Types and Changes

Structure isn't static, it changes over time.

### Structure Conversion

**Uptrend Structure Converting to Downtrend Structure:**

Process:
1. Originally uptrend structure (HH, HL)
2. When price falls from high to low, low is lower than previous low (LL)
3. Uptrend structure broken
4. If subsequent bounce can't make new high (LH)
5. Downtrend structure begins forming

Key signals:
- Low breakout: Low lower than previous low
- High can't break: Bounce high lower than previous high

**Downtrend Structure Converting to Uptrend Structure:**

Process:
1. Originally downtrend structure (LH, LL)
2. When price bounces from low, low is higher than previous low (HL)
3. Downtrend structure broken
4. If subsequent rise can make new high (HH)
5. Uptrend structure begins forming

Key signals:
- Low lifting: Low higher than previous low
- High breakout: Rising high higher than previous high

**Sideways Structure Formation:**

When price can't continue original upward or downward structure:
- Highs around same level
- Lows around same level
- Forms range consolidation
- This is trend pause or reversal signal

### Structure Incompleteness

**Incomplete Uptrend Structure:**
- Only higher lows (HL), but no higher highs
- Indicates uptrend momentum weakening, possible trend change

**Incomplete Downtrend Structure:**
- Only lower highs (LH), but no lower lows
- Indicates downtrend momentum weakening, possible trend change

**When Structure Incomplete:**
- Trade cautiously
- Wait for structure to complete
- Observe volume and momentum indicators

### Structure False Signals

**Fake Breakout:**
- Price briefly breaks structure, then returns to original structure
- Need to wait for confirmation
- Volume and subsequent price action important

**Fake Turn:**
- Structure appears about to convert, but finally returns to original structure
- May be correction, not reversal
- Don't judge structure conversion too early

## Technical Tools for Identifying Structure

There are various methods to identify and confirm market structure.

### Trendlines

**Uptrend Line (Uptrend Structure Support Line):**
- Connect two or more lows
- Lows continuously rising
- Trendline slopes upward
- Price runs above trendline
- When trendline broken, uptrend structure may end

**Downtrend Line (Downtrend Structure Resistance Line):**
- Connect two or more highs
- Highs continuously declining
- Trendline slopes downward
- Price runs below trendline
- When trendline broken, downtrend structure may end

**Significance of Trendlines:**
- Visualize structure direction
- Provide support/resistance levels
- Breakout signals structure may convert

### Moving Average System

**MA Arrangement Reflects Structure:**

**Uptrend Structure:**
- Short MA > Medium MA > Long MA
- MA bullish alignment
- MAs diverge upward
- Price above all MAs

**Downtrend Structure:**
- Short MA < Medium MA < Long MA
- MA bearish alignment
- MAs diverge downward
- Price below all MAs

**Sideways Structure:**
- MAs entangled
- No clear alignment direction
- Price fluctuates above and below MAs

**Significance of MAs:**
- Filter short-term noise
- Confirm structure direction
- Provide dynamic support/resistance

### High Low Marking Method

**Manually Mark Highs and Lows:**

Method:
1. Find all highs and lows
2. Connect highs with lines
3. Connect lows with lines
4. Observe arrangement of highs and lows

**Standard:**
- High: Higher than previous N and next N candles
- Low: Lower than previous N and next N candles
- N value adjusted based on timeframe (3-5 for intraday, 5-10 for daily)

**Significance:**
- Most direct structure identification method
- Doesn't depend on indicators
- Can customize parameters

### ZigZag Indicator

**Automatically Identify Highs, Lows, and Structure:**

ZigZag indicator's role:
- Automatically mark highs and lows
- Connect highs and lows to show structure
- Ignore minor fluctuations
- Only show important turning points

**Parameter Settings:**
- Depth: Usually set to 10-15%
- Retracement: Usually set to 5-10%
- Larger parameter = fewer, more important structures identified

**Pros:**
- Automated, reduces subjective judgment
- Clearly shows structure
- Can quantify structure characteristics

**Cons:**
- Lagging indicator
- Parameter settings affect results
- Can't predict structure conversion

## Relationship Between Structure and Trend

Structure and trend are closely related but not the same concept.

### Structure Defines Trend

**Trend = Direction of Structure**

**Uptrend:**
- Defined by uptrend structure
- Higher highs and higher lows
- Buying pressure continuously strengthening

**Downtrend:**
- Defined by downtrend structure
- Lower highs and lower lows
- Selling pressure continuously strengthening

**No Trend (Consolidation):**
- Defined by sideways structure
- Highs and lows around same level
- Buying and selling pressure balanced

### Structure Strength Reflects Trend Strength

**Strong Structure = Strong Trend:**

**Strong Uptrend Structure:**
- Pullbacks between higher lows very shallow
- Each rise has large magnitude
- Volume supports
- Steep trendline

**Weak Uptrend Structure:**
- Pullbacks between higher lows very deep
- Rising magnitude gradually decreases
- Volume doesn't support
- Gentle trendline

**Strong Downtrend Structure:**
- Bounces between lower highs very weak
- Each decline has large magnitude
- Panic selling
- Steep trendline

**Weak Downtrend Structure:**
- Bounces between lower highs relatively strong
- Declining magnitude gradually decreases
- Buying gradually strengthens
- Gentle trendline

### Structure Conversion Foretells Trend Conversion

**Structure conversion is early signal of trend conversion:**

**Signals for Up to Down:**
1. Higher low broken (LL)
2. Uptrend structure broken
3. Bounce can't make new high (LH)
4. Downtrend structure forms
5. Uptrend ends, downtrend begins

**Signals for Down to Up:**
1. Lower low broken (HL)
2. Downtrend structure broken
3. Rise can make new high (HH)
4. Uptrend structure forms
5. Downtrend ends, uptrend begins

**Signals for Sideways to Trend:**
1. Price breaks upper or lower boundary of range
2. Forms new highs and lows
3. Structure starts tilting
4. Consolidation ends, trend begins

## Structure in Trading Applications

Understanding structure is crucial for developing trading strategies.

### Trend Following Strategy

**Trend Following in Uptrend Structure:**

**Entry Signals:**
1. Confirm uptrend structure (HH, HL)
2. Price pulls back near higher low
3. Bottoming signal appears (like candle pattern, volume change)
4. Enter long

**Stop Loss Setup:**
- Below higher low
- Distance adjusted based on structure strength
- Strong structure can have tighter stop
- Weak structure needs wider stop

**Target Setup:**
- Previous high (conservative)
- New high (aggressive)
- Structure Fibonacci levels (38.2%, 61.8%)

**Trend Following in Downtrend Structure:**

**Entry Signals:**
1. Confirm downtrend structure (LH, LL)
2. Price bounces near lower high
3. Resistance signal appears (like candle pattern, volume change)
4. Enter short

**Stop Loss Setup:**
- Above lower high
- Distance adjusted based on structure strength

**Target Setup:**
- Previous low (conservative)
- New low (aggressive)
- Structure Fibonacci levels

### Structure Conversion Strategy

**Shorting Opportunity from Up to Down:**

**Signal Confirmation:**
1. Higher low broken
2. Bounce can't make new high
3. Confirm downtrend structure starting

**Entry Points:**
- Breaking key support
- Or when bouncing at lower high

**Risk:**
- Might just be correction, not reversal
- Need to wait for complete structure confirmation

**Longing Opportunity from Down to Up:**

**Signal Confirmation:**
1. Lower low broken
2. Rise can make new high
3. Confirm uptrend structure starting

**Entry Points:**
- Breaking key resistance
- Or when pulling back at higher low

**Risk:**
- Might just be bounce, not reversal
- Need to wait for complete structure confirmation

### Sideways Structure Trading Strategy

**Range Trading:**

**Trading Strategy:**
1. Confirm sideways structure (highs/lows at same level)
2. Buy near low, sell near high
3. Strictly execute breakout stop loss
4. Don't expect breakout

**Stop Loss Setup:**
- Below range lower edge (long)
- Above range upper edge (short)

**Target Setup:**
- Other end of range
- Don't expect post-breakout moves

**Risk:**
- Must strictly stop loss on breakout
- Range may convert to trend

## Quantitative Structure Definition

From quantitative trading perspective, we need mathematical methods to define structure.

### High Low Based Quantification

**Defining Highs and Lows:**

```python
# Pseudo-code
def is_high(price_data, index, n=5):
    return price_data[index] == max(price_data[index-n:index+n+1])

def is_low(price_data, index, n=5):
    return price_data[index] == min(price_data[index-n:index+n+1])
```

**Defining Structure:**

```python
# Uptrend structure
def is_uptrend_structure(highs, lows):
    # All lows higher than previous low
    # All highs higher than previous high
    return all(lows[i] > lows[i-1] for i in range(1, len(lows))) and \
           all(highs[i] > highs[i-1] for i in range(1, len(highs)))

# Downtrend structure
def is_downtrend_structure(highs, lows):
    # All lows lower than previous low
    # All highs lower than previous high
    return all(lows[i] < lows[i-1] for i in range(1, len(lows))) and \
           all(highs[i] < highs[i-1] for i in range(1, len(highs)))
```

### Trendline Based Quantification

**Trendline Fitting:**

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import numpy as np

# Uptrend line (connect lows)
def uptrend_slope(lows):
    x = np.arange(len(lows)).reshape(-1, 1)
    y = np.array(lows).reshape(-1, 1)
    model = LinearRegression()
    model.fit(x, y)
    return model.coef_[0][0]  # Positive slope

# Downtrend line (connect highs)
def downtrend_slope(highs):
    x = np.arange(len(highs)).reshape(-1, 1)
    y = np.array(highs).reshape(-1, 1)
    model = LinearRegression()
    model.fit(x, y)
    return model.coef_[0][0]  # Negative slope
```

### MA Based Quantification

**MA Arrangement:**

```python
# Bullish alignment
def is_bullish_alignment(short_ma, medium_ma, long_ma):
    return short_ma > medium_ma > long_ma

# Bearish alignment
def is_bearish_alignment(short_ma, medium_ma, long_ma):
    return short_ma < medium_ma < long_ma
```

## Practical Structure Analysis

In actual trading, how to apply structure analysis?

### Step 1: Identify Current Structure

**Identify Highs and Lows:**
- Manually mark or use indicators
- Determine major highs/lows
- Filter out minor noise

**Judge Structure Type:**
- Uptrend structure: HH, HL
- Downtrend structure: LH, LL
- Sideways structure: Highs/lows at same level

### Step 2: Evaluate Structure Strength

**Structure Strength Evaluation Metrics:**
- Pullback/bounce magnitude
- Each swing's magnitude
- Volume support
- Trendline slope
- Structure duration

**Strong Structure Characteristics:**
- Shallow pullbacks/bounces
- Large and consistent swing magnitudes
- Volume support
- Long structure duration

### Step 3: Find Trading Opportunities

**Trend Following:**
- Uptrend structure: Long at higher lows
- Downtrend structure: Short at lower highs
- Set reasonable stops and targets

**Structure Conversion Trading:**
- Wait for structure to be broken
- Wait for new structure to confirm
- Enter at structure conversion

### Step 4: Risk Control

**Stop Loss Setup:**
- Trend following: Outside key structure points
- Structure conversion: Near conversion point
- Adjust stop width based on structure strength

**Position Sizing:**
- Strong structure: Can increase position appropriately
- Weak structure: Decrease position
- Sideways structure: Small position or stay out

### Step 5: Continuous Monitoring

**Monitor Structure Changes:**
- Structure break signals appearing
- Structure conversion signals appearing
- Structure strength changing

**Adjust Strategy:**
- Adjust position based on structure changes
- Adjust stop based on structure strength
- Choose strategy based on structure type

## Common Misconceptions

When understanding structure, avoid these common misconceptions.

### Misconception 1: Only Trade When Structure Perfect

**Misconception: Must wait for perfect HH, HL or LH, LL structure**

Reality:
- Perfect structures are rare
- Some swings have small overlaps
- Key is identifying structure's dominant direction
- Don't miss opportunities pursuing perfection

### Misconception 2: Enter Immediately on Structure Conversion

**Misconception: Should enter immediately when structure converts**

Reality:
- Structure conversion might be fake
- Need to wait for complete structure confirmation
- Might need several swings to confirm
- Don't rush to enter

### Misconception 3: Structure Equals Trend

**Misconception: Structure and trend are same thing**

Reality:
- Structure defines trend's direction
- But structure strength and persistence equally important
- Some structures very weak, trend might end anytime
- Don't just look at structure type, also look at structure quality

### Misconception 4: All Timeframe Structures Same

**Misconception: All timeframe structures should be same**

Reality:
- Different timeframes might have different structures
- Daily might be uptrend structure, 4H might be downtrend structure
- This is normal correction
- Focus on your trading timeframe's structure

### Misconception 5: Structure Never Changes

**Misconception: Once structure forms, it continues forever**

Reality:
- Structure constantly changes
- Might go from uptrend to sideways to downtrend
- Need continuous monitoring
- Flexibly adapt to structure changes

## Conclusion

Market structure is the skeleton of price action, key to understanding structure is:

1. **Core Concept**: Relative position relationship of highs and lows
2. **Three Types**: Uptrend (HH, HL), downtrend (LH, LL), sideways structure
3. **Confirmation Method**: Complete swings needed to confirm structure
4. **Structure Levels**: Different levels have different highs/lows
5. **Structure Conversion**: Structure changes over time
6. **Trend Relationship**: Structure defines trend direction and strength
7. **Trading Applications**: Trend following, structure conversion, range trading
8. **Quantitative Definition**: Can use mathematical methods to quantify structure

In quantitative trading, structure isn't vague concept but object that can be quantified, tested, optimized:

- Use algorithms to identify highs/lows
- Use rules to define structure type
- Use backtesting to verify structure strategies
- Use statistics to evaluate structure effectiveness

Essence of structure analysis: By identifying arrangement of price highs and lows, understand market state and direction, thereby developing corresponding trading strategies.

Successful structure analysis isn't pursuing perfect structure but:
- Identify current structure type
- Evaluate structure strength
- Look for structure conversion opportunities
- Strictly execute risk management
- Flexibly adapt to structure changes

Understanding structure, analyzing structure, trading structure - this is core skill every technical analyst must master.
